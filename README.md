## Book Finder Build Roadmap (Priority Order)

**Phase 1 – Core Foundation (MVP must work)**

 Setup Project → Create React app, basic folder structure.

 Search Bar → Implement input + trigger API call (Open Library).

 Show Search Results (grid) → Render list of BookCards with title, author, cover (no filters yet).

 Loader + Error Handling → Show spinner while fetching, error message if API fails.

**Phase 2 – Core User Flow**

 Book Details Modal → Open popup on card click, show full details (title, author, description, rating).

 Responsive Layout → Adjust grid (desktop vs. mobile).

**Phase 3 – Advanced Features**

 Filters Bar (on top) → Add author filter + page range filter.

 Infinite Scroll → Fetch next page as user scrolls.

 Load More Button (fallback) → Manual trigger to fetch next page.

 Empty State Message → If no results, show friendly message.

**Phase 4 – Landing Page Polish**

 Header + Tagline → Add logo/name + small slogan.

 Fixed Genre Collections → Horizontal rows (Fantasy, Science & Tech, etc.), each fetching from API.

**Phase 5 – Extras & UX Polishing**

 Accessibility → Modal keyboard handling, alt text for covers.

 Fallbacks for Missing Data → Show placeholder cover or “No rating available.”

 Final Styling & Minimalist UI Polish → Spacing, fonts, colors, smoothnes
